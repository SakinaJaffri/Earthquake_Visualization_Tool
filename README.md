# Earthquake Visualization Tool

## Background

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is entrusted with the task of providing comprehensive scientific data concerning natural hazards, ecosystem health, and the impacts of climate change and land use. To better fulfill this mission, the USGS seeks to enhance its earthquake data visualization tools. By creating more informative and accessible visualizations, the USGS aims to educate the public and government entities about critical environmental issues, thereby fostering greater awareness and support for their initiatives.

## Instructions

### Creating the Earthquake Visualization

To achieve this goal, follow these steps:

1. **Obtaining the Dataset:**
    - Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page [here](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).
    - Choose a dataset, such as "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days."
    - Retrieve the JSON representation of the selected dataset from the provided URL.

2. **Importing and Visualizing the Data:**
    - Utilize Leaflet to create an interactive map that displays all earthquakes from the dataset based on their geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude).
    - Customize data markers to reflect earthquake magnitude (size) and depth (color).
    - Larger markers represent earthquakes with higher magnitudes, while darker colors indicate greater depth.
    - Implement popups to provide detailed information about each earthquake upon clicking its marker.
    - Incorporate a legend to provide contextual information about earthquake magnitude and depth.

This visualization tool will enable the USGS to effectively communicate earthquake data, facilitating informed decision-making and public engagement with environmental issues.
